This is the first graded project in my Front-End Development course.
I was tasked with creating & designing a landing page for a luxury boutique jeweler based out of Austin, TX.
Using only HTML & CSS.
I had to create it with a Top Logo Section, A menu Bar Below, a promo Flex Row, 3 column flex row, and a footer.
